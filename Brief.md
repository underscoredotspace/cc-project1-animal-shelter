# Project - Web Programming with Ruby

Over the next week you will build an app to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

* Object oriented programming with Ruby
* Test Driven Development
* Web Programming (REST, MVC)
* Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)

## Briefs

These briefs detail what is expected of you, including an MVP. Note that the MVP is the **Minimum** Viable Product. You are strongly encouraged to go beyond these specifications, and some possible extensions are provided.

Talk through your ideas with an instructor during the planning process, and before you begin coding.

### Animal Shelter

The Scottish Animal Shelter accepts orphaned or stray animals and takes care of them until they can be adopted by a new owner. The shelter has a list of potential new owners for the animals. Animals may take a while to be trained up and made healthy before being available for adoption.

They are looking for a management system to keep track of their animals and owners.

#### MVP:

* A list of all their animals and their admission date
* Mark an animal as being adoptable/not adoptable
* Assign an animal to a new owner
* List all the owners and their adopted animals

#### Possible Extensions:

* CRUD actions for animals/owners
* Have separate pages for animals ready for adoption and ones still in training/vet care
* Search for animals by breed/type
* Any other ideas you might come up with
